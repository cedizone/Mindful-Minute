# Mindfulness and Meditation App
This is an Android application designed to help users practice mindfulness and meditation techniques in short sessions throughout the day. The app allows users to set reminders to take a break and practice a quick mindfulness exercise, such as deep breathing or a body scan, for just a few minutes. The app also offers guided meditations for longer sessions, and tracks users' progress over time with features such as a meditation timer and a journal to record thoughts and feelings before and after each session. The app includes personalized recommendations based on users' goals and preferences, such as reducing stress or improving focus.
